# 2d_array
problem sets 

1) Problem: Find the maximum element in a 2D array.
Write a Java program that finds and returns the maximum element in a given 2D array.

2) Problem: Calculate the sum of each row in a 2D array.
Write a Java program that calculates and prints the sum of each row in a given 2D array.

3) Problem: Calculate the sum of each column in a 2D array.
Write a Java program that calculates and prints the sum of each column in a given 2D array.

4) Problem: Transpose a 2D array.
Write a Java program that takes a 2D array as input and returns its transpose, where the rows become columns and vice versa.

5) Problem: Check if a 2D array is symmetric.
Write a Java program that checks whether a given 2D array is symmetric, i.e., if it is equal to its transpose.

6) Problem: Rotate a 2D array by 90 degrees clockwise.
Write a Java program that rotates a given 2D array by 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.

7) Problem: Find the saddle point in a 2D array.
Write a Java program that finds and returns the saddle point in a given 2D array. A saddle point is an element that is both the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.

8) Problem: Check if a 2D array is a magic square.
